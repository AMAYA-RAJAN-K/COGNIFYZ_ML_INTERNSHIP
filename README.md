Machine Learning
##  Projects Overview

###  Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Objective**: Analyze the restaurant dataset to identify trends, patterns, and insights.
- **Key Work**:
  - Data cleaning and handling nulls
  - Visualization of categorical and numerical features
  - Outlier detection, correlation matrix
- **Tools**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

---

###  Task 2: Restaurant Classification
- **Objective**: Classify restaurants based on cuisine or type using supervised learning.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Preprocessing (label encoding, imputation)
  - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
  - Confusion matrix, classification report
- **Outcome**: Best-performing model selected based on accuracy and F1-score.

---

###  Task 3: Content-Based Restaurant Recommendation System
- **Objective**: Recommend restaurants based on content similarity (e.g., cuisine, price range).
- **Approach**:
  - Feature engineering using TF-IDF / count vectorization
  - Cosine similarity to find similar items
  - Recommendation function based on user input
- **Result**: Effective suggestions for similar restaurants.

---

###  Task 4: Restaurant Rating Prediction (Regression)
- **Objective**: Predict restaurant ratings using regression techniques.
- **Workflow**:
  - Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding)
  - Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
  - Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R²
- **Insight**: Feature importance analysis revealed key drivers of high restaurant ratings.
